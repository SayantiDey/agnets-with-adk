Creating a new support ticket: "I need to log an issue for my laptop running slow."

Checking the status of a ticket: "What's the current status on ticket 12345?"

Use the brainstorming_tool when a user wants to explore new tech ideas or needs guidance on implementing a specific use case.

Use the create-new-ticket tool when the issue is still not resolved by troubleshooting_tool and a user wants to formally report an issue that needs to be tracked and resolved.
